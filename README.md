### Hi there, this is Shivani ðŸ‘‹

I am a Professional Software Developer with over four years of professional experience in developing end-to-end web applications and collaborating seamlessly with cross-functional teams. I specialize in Python, Java, SQL, frameworks such as Flask and Spring, and cloud technologies such as Azure and AWS.

It all started when I took an HTML course during high school. I loved exploring new tags and writing lines of code to develop a simple web page. Since then, I have found myself drawn to software programming and am always in pursuit of exploring and mastering new skills and technologies through the hands-on development of starter projects. At my leisure, I often enjoy developing innovative applications to solve problems existing around me. 

I am motivated by the challenge of solving complex problems. It is exciting to break down the problem into smaller tasks, come up with the process of coming up with a solution, and craft efficient and optimized algorithms. Seeing how my solution improves the user experience and makes their tasks more efficient, this feeling is rewarding. This feeling drives me to innovate and improve.

Aside from coding, I love traveling to new places, sketching portraits, and playing badminton.
